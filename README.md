# How to create your own UX writing guide

Welcome to the **How to create your own UX writing guide** Zeitspace Session!
Let's make sure you're all set up.

If you didn't attend the session in person, no problem. You may want to [read the slide deck](https://github.com/zeitspace/web-accessibility-session/blob/master/Resources/Zeitspace%20Session%20-%20Web%20accessibility%20slides.pdf) for a bit of background, but it isn't required.

## Setup

* We are using Zoom as our online meeting platform. It doesn't take long to [install from their site](https://zoom.us/download).
* We'll share some exercise materials using Google Drive. To take advantage of these resources most easily, make sure you can [access Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/).
* A pencil or pen, and some paper might be handy.

## Activity 1 - Voice and tone chart

A voice and tone chart is a creative guidance tool that can help:
* make writing decisions or break ties when several options exist
* build consistency across writers on a team
* align UX writing with the goals of the organization and the user
* help build trust through a "consistent, cohesive, visual and verbal voice" (Bloomstein, 2020)

A [description of the voice and tone chart activity](https://www.zeitspace.com/voice-and-tone-chart) is available on the Zeitspace web site.

## Activity 2 - UX writing guide template

Learning from (and leaning on) several of the publicly available style guides and UX writing guides (check out our favourite ones in the Resources section), we've created a skeleton template for you to start with.

A [description of how to use the UX writing guide template](https://www.zeitspace.com/voice-and-tone-chart) is available on the Zeitspace web site.

## Activity 3 - Iterative rewriting

This activity shows how to rewrite a block of text deliberately and with consideration for several elements of strong UX writing. The four stages and goals of the activity are:
* make the writing *purposeful*
* make the writing *concise*
* make the writing *conversational*
* make the writing *clear*

A [description of the iterative rewriting activity](https://www.zeitspace.com/iterative-rewriting) is available on the Zeitspace web site.

#### Wrap-up

After learning about voice and tone, learning about what might be covered in a UX writing guide, and improving UX text through deliberate rewriting, we hope you have a good start on how to create a useful UX writing guide for you and your team.

## Frequently asked questions

##### What is UX writing? What is it not?
UX writing is writing for interfaces of products or services. UX writing may involve:
* button text
* error messages
* dialog text
* onboarding information

Text is used throughout the interfaces we create and is an integral part of the experience. Poor UX writing can work against the efforts of people using the products we create.

UX writing is *not*:
* Marketing copy (e.g., company website pages; e-books; whitepapers; blogs; social media copy)
* Technical writing (e.g., a manual)

##### What's the difference between voice and tone?

It can be hard to know the difference between voice and tone but here are a few analogies we’ve come across that help:

Writing is Designing describes voice like your personality (e.g., outgoing, adventurous, reserved) whereas tone is the emotion (happy, frustrated, serious, light-hearted). While your emotions (and tone) change based on your mood, your personality (or voice) will always stay the same.

Another helpful analogy from Strategic Writing for UX:

> “When I overhear my mother answer a phone call, I can quickly tell by her tone whether the call is from a stranger or loved one — but I am never confused that it is my mother’s voice.”

In general, your voice will always stay the same, but your tone will change based on the stage the person using your product or service is in. For example, Writing is Designing, uses the example of insurance company Geico, which has a strong brand voice. But when someone is filing a claim, the tone changes — the tone is supportive, but the language is stripped down so that it’s simple and clear. People don’t want to mess around with a clever mascot when they’ve just been in a crash and Geico recognized that by changing its tone to match the situation.

##### Where's the first place you should start with UX writing?

Consistency is important, so set guidelines for UX writing to help get everyone on the same page and settle arguments as they arise. You can do that with a UX writing guide. But you don’t need to reinvent the wheel and create one from scratch. There are lots of style guides out there (we largely use The Canadian Press Stylebook and the accompanying Canadian Press Caps and Spelling at Zeitspace, for example) and create exceptions to suit your needs. While The Canadian Press Stylebook omits the Oxford comma, we created an exception in our Zeitspace style guide to include it.

Take a look at established and respected UX style and style guides to learn how they tackle consistency and exceptions. The Resources section, below, has links to some of the better known ones.

##### Style guide vs UX writing guide, what's the difference? How are they similar?

Though there’s some overlap between a style guide and a UX writing guide, (Oxford commas, for example, exist in both of the guides we created for Zeitspace), they are not the same thing. While both will make your writing consistent, the goal of each is different. One is about your organization, the other is about the people you serve.
* A style guide is like a map for how you want to communicate your brand and specific voice to the world. It often includes guidance on visual design and interaction design, in addition to writing.
* A UX writing guide focuses on the consistent application of voice, tone, and mechanics in order to make people's experience with a product or service efficient.

##### What should I do if our UX writing guide clashes with the platform style guide (e.g., Google Material Design, Apple Human Interface Guidelines, Microsoft Fluent, etc.)?

* Be true to your voice first.
* Respect the work you and your stakeholders have done to create your writing guide.
* Your UX writing guide will be informed by the best platform guides already out there. (Both Zeitspace's editorial style guide and UX writing guide are influenced by other well-established guides.)
* Discuss and understand the sorts of situations you may encounter where you'll diverge from the UX writing guide. For example, as a consultancy, Zeitspace often adopts the voice and goals of a client's project.
* Document exceptions or cases where your style guide differs (and why). Your UX writing guide should be a living document: update it as you come across new situations.

##### How does UX writing relate to writing for marketing purposes?

The goal of marketing (and writing for marketing) is to serve the brand and the business. It’s how you present yourself to the world and it’s often self serving. The goal of UX writing is to serve the *user* of the product or service, not the organization that created them.

You can get away with some tactics for marketing, such as clever and witty writing, which doesn’t work as well in UX writing (these same tactics might backfire/frustrate the user or slow them down). There are exceptions though. For some companies/products, the product is the brand and they can get away with occasionally irreverent copy (e.g., Mailchimp, Slack).
